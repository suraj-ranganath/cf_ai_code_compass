# CI/CD Type Check Fix

## Problem

The GitHub Actions workflow was failing during the lint step with errors like:
- `Cannot find module 'react'`
- `Cannot find namespace 'NodeJS'`
- `JSX element implicitly has type 'any'`

## Root Cause

The root `tsconfig.json` was configured for **Cloudflare Workers** (with `lib: ["ES2022", "WebWorker"]`), but it was also including frontend files (`pages-frontend/src/**/*`). When the CI workflow ran `npx tsc --noEmit` from the root, it tried to type-check React/DOM code using Worker types, causing all the errors.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed `tsconfig.json` (Root)

**Before:**
```json
"include": ["workers/**/*", "pages-frontend/src/**/*"],
"exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", ".wrangler"]
```

**After:**
```json
"include": ["workers/**/*"],
"exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", ".wrangler", "pages-frontend"]
```

Now the root tsconfig **only** type-checks Workers code.

### 2. CI Workflow Already Correct

The workflow was already properly structured to check both separately:

```yaml
- name: Type check Workers
  run: npx tsc --noEmit  # Uses root tsconfig (Workers only now)

- name: Install frontend dependencies
  working-directory: ./pages-frontend
  run: npm ci

- name: Type check Frontend
  working-directory: ./pages-frontend
  run: npx tsc --noEmit  # Uses pages-frontend/tsconfig.json (DOM/React)
```

### 3. Removed Redundant Test Job

Deleted the `test` job since there are no tests configured.

## Verification

Run locally to confirm:

```bash
# Check Workers (from root)
npx tsc --noEmit
# ✅ Should pass with no errors

# Check Frontend (from pages-frontend)
cd pages-frontend && npx tsc --noEmit
# ✅ Should pass with no errors
```

## Result

✅ Workers type checking: Uses `lib: ["ES2022", "WebWorker"]`  
✅ Frontend type checking: Uses `lib: ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"]`  
✅ No type conflicts between Workers and React code  
✅ CI/CD pipeline will now pass lint checks
