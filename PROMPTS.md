**Model**: GitHub Copilot (GPT-4 based)

**User Prompt**:
```
CONTEXT:
See instructions below for Cloudflare AI app assignment. Submit GitHub repo URL for the AI project here.
Instructions: We plan to fast track review of candidates who complete an assignment to build a type of AI-powered application on Cloudflare. An AI-powered application should include the following components:
LLM (recommend using Llama 3.3 on Workers AI), or an external LLM of your choice
Workflow / coordination (recommend using Workflows, Workers or Durable Objects)
User input via chat or voice (recommend using Pages or Realtime)
Memory or state
Find additional documentation here.

To be considered, your repository name must be prefixed with cf_ai_, must include a README.md file with project documentation and clear running instructions to try out components (either locally or via deployed link). AI-assisted coding is encouraged, but you must include AI prompts used in PROMPTS.md

PROJECT IDEA:
A voice-first agent that onboards you to any GitHub repo: it curates prerequisite readings, builds a repo "primer," then quizzes you with thought-provoking questions before unlocking deeper tasks.

Paste a repo URL, speak your goals ("I need to change the auth flow"). The agent crawls the repo, extracts structure and hotspots, assembles a short "pre-read" (files, concepts, external docs), and leads a Socratic walk-through with targeted questions. It remembers what stumped you and generates a 10–15 minute micro-study plan and flashcards.

INSTRUCTIONS:
You are my builder agent. For every step in this session and future sessions, append to PROMPTS.md a running log in this exact format:

## [ISO timestamp]
Model: <model-name-as-reported-by-you>
User Prompt: "<paste the user message you're responding to verbatim>"
Actions Taken:
- <bullet list of concrete actions, files created/modified, commands run, APIs called>
- <links to relevant docs you consulted>
Outcome:
- <what changed / artifacts produced / errors resolved>


Create and push a public GitHub repo now named cf_ai_repo_socratic_mentor. If GitHub CLI is available, use it:

gh repo create cf_ai_repo_socratic_mentor --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
If not, fall back to Git + GitHub REST API. Ensure main branch is default.

Project goal: Voice-first Socratic agent that onboards users to any GitHub repo. It:

builds a repo primer and prerequisite "Foundational Concepts,"

conducts a Socratic code walk-through via voice or text (voice primary),

generates a 10–15 minute micro-study plan + 5 flashcards,

stores per-user session state and semantic memory.

Stack (Cloudflare-native): Workers AI (LLM), Cloudflare Agents (tools), Durable Objects (state + RTC), Vectorize (embeddings), Realtime (voice), Pages (frontend), KV (prefs), R2 (optional cache).

Create a detailed README.md (living doc) with:

Project overview, "Why Cloudflare" section, architecture diagram placeholder

Feature checklist tied to assignment rubric (LLM, workflow, voice, memory)

Exact setup and deploy prerequisites (Wrangler, CF account, bindings)

UI preview section (to be updated with screenshots/GIF later)

Troubleshooting section (blank placeholders for now)

Populate prompts/*.txt with seed prompts (system + tools) and write stubs in workers files.

Add wrangler.toml with placeholder bindings for: AI, VECTORIZE_INDEX, DO_NAMESPACE, KV, R2, D1 (optional), CF_REALTIME.

Commit & push the scaffold. Log everything you did in PROMPTS.md and note the model name. Keep README.md clearly marked as "continually updated."
